# Build Error Fix - Complete! ✅

## 🐛 Issue Found & Fixed

### Problem:
```
src/react-app/components/ServiceGrid.tsx(47,16): error TS2741: 
Property 'onOrderClick' is missing in type '{ key: string; service: Service; onServiceClick: (service: Service) => void; }' 
but required in type 'ServiceCardProps'.
```

### Root Cause:
- ServiceCard component was updated to require `onOrderClick` prop
- ServiceGrid component was not passing this required prop
- Type mismatch between Service interfaces (id: string vs id: number)

## 🔧 Fix Applied

### 1. Updated ServiceGrid Component ✅
- **Added OrderForm import**: `import OrderForm from './OrderForm';`
- **Added state management**: 
  - `isOrderFormOpen` state for order form modal
  - `orderService` state for selected service
- **Added event handlers**:
  - `handleOrderClick()` - Opens order form with selected service
  - `handleCloseOrderForm()` - Closes order form modal
- **Added onOrderClick prop**: Passed to ServiceCard component
- **Added OrderForm component**: Integrated with proper service data mapping

### 2. Fixed Type Conversion ✅
- **Service ID conversion**: `parseInt(orderService.id)` to convert string to number
- **Service data mapping**: Proper mapping from ServiceGrid Service type to OrderForm expected type

### 3. Complete Integration ✅
- **Order flow**: Service Card → Order Form → Database
- **File upload**: Integrated in order form
- **Admin management**: Orders appear in admin panel
